A simple library to convert gist code and GitHub files into gist-like html

## Author
Sam Pastoriza

## Inspiration
I wanted to inject gist-like html into a Wysiwyg editor, but was unable to do so easily. I will be using code inspired by these two repositories, so thanks to github users [robertkrimen](https://github.com/robertkrimen) and [blairvanderhoof](https://github.com/blairvanderhoof)
